Just kidding, everyone knows that, right? [Right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub6FIPpojoI) ;)

## Features
What we managed to achive:
* Switching between start and board screen.
* Board fields lock after putting a sign on them.
* The game board locks itself after win or draw.
* Use Local Storage to information about last three games.
* Our app is responsive.
* It works and looks nice :)

Ideas on how to make our app even better:
* Add more sound effects and button to switch off/on sound.
* Playing against computer (AI)
* Animations
